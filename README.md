## The Shadow of the Ramlord 
## By Dark Craft Studios

### Installation instructions:

* 1: Download storv1.0.7z and open up the archive
* 2: Extract the folder "The-Shadow-Of-The-Ramlord" into your ".../amnesia/custom_stories" directory.
* 3: Launch from the main menu!

### House Rules:

There are no tinderboxes or many manipulative puzzles, as it is a story first driven modification! While there are eastereggs throughout a few of the levels, some of which might unlock a secret room here or a special conversation there. These are thoroughly optional to the core experience the mod aims for.

Headphones, dim lighting, and a focus on the story / lore / message rather than expecting to be constantly scared out of your mind.
