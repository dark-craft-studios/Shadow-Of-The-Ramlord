House Rules:

There are no tinderboxes; be sparing with your oil. 

There is only one easteregg room/secret location.

Headphones are a must, it is how we balanced our audio and VA.

This is a story first modification, so focus in on the lore, atmosphere, story and events rather than expecting to be scared much at all. Our goal was not to make you jump, but to contemplate the narrative.
